/**
 * Funnel analytics, in one place.
 *
 * TRANSPORT RULE, and it is the whole point of this file:
 *
 *   Meta  ->  Conversions API, server side, via `/api/capi`.
 *             The browser pixel fires `PageView` and NOTHING else. Its only
 *             other job is setting the first-party `_fbp` / `_fbc` cookies,
 *             which we read back here and hand to the server for matching.
 *
 *   GA4   ->  browser side, via gtag, mirroring every Meta event under the same
 *             name, EXCEPT `Purchase` and `sales`, which are Meta only.
 *
 * The event table:
 *
 *   PageView             every page load          pixel (see MetaPixel.tsx)
 *   ViewContent          P1, after a 3s dwell     CAPI + GA4
 *   AddToCart            P1, a CTA is tapped      CAPI + GA4
 *   CompleteRegistration form submitted           CAPI + GA4
 *   Lead                 form submitted           CAPI + GA4   (kept for any
 *                                                 campaign still optimising to it)
 *   QualifiedLead        form submitted, ONLY if  CAPI + GA4
 *                        Q1 and Q2 both pass
 *   oto_reset_plus_add   P2, add-on switched on   CAPI + GA4
 *   oto_reset_cta        P2, yes at the base price     CAPI + GA4
 *   oto_reset_plus_cta   P2, yes with the add-on       CAPI + GA4
 *   oto_decline          P2, "no thank you"       CAPI + GA4
 *   whatsapp_join        any WhatsApp button      CAPI + GA4
 *   registration_step    modal step reached       GA4 only (noise on Meta)
 *   Purchase             P3 purchase pages        CAPI only  (see lib/purchase.ts)
 *   sales                P3 purchase pages        CAPI only  (see lib/purchase.ts)
 *
 * Every call is defensive. If a tag is missing, an ad blocker removed it, or the
 * network is down, the funnel carries on silently. Nothing here ever blocks
 * navigation or throws into a click handler.
